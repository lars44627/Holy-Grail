    <p>Hello. I am from Apex North Carolina and I am studting CIT. I recently got back from a mission in Brazil where I learned Portugese.

        I also just got married about two months ago and am working in appliance repair as well as doing school.

                <p>My state is one of the classic southern states. It's hot in the summers and not that cold in the winters. I practically live in a forest,
                    and yet I'm still in the city. The humidity can do a number on visitors, and mosquitos aern't fun, but it's still a blast.</p>
